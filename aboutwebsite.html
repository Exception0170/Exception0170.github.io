          <h3>> Website style</h3>
          I was making this website in stryle of Portal 2's Aperture computers screens and Absolute Solver UI.<br>
          Also, took inspiration from <a href="https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term">Cool Retro Term</a> - Amber colors, CRT effect.<br>
          The font used is VT323, which is a pixel font that looks like old computer terminals.<br>
          Website uses only HTML and CSS, no JavaScript is used for the main functionality.<br>
          <h3>> Website purpose</h3>
          I made this website mostly for fun, to practice HTML/CSS, and also make a page of myself.<br>
          Additionally, it will be used for brief descriptions of my projects, and maybe some documentation.
          <h3>> Code in background</h3>
          On certain pages, you can see some code in the background, which is just for fun.<br>
          However, on projects pages, for example, <a href="/projects/tgl.html">projects://tgl</a>, you can see real TGL library code.<br>
          Just thought it's a nice fun fact.
