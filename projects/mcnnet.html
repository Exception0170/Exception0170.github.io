    <h2>contents://About</h2>
    MCNnet2 stands for "Minecraft Computer Node network, version 2.x".<br>
    It consists of several networking protocols, making a complete networking suite for Minecraft computers.<br>
    It is written in Lua, and is designed to be used with OpenComputers mod.<br>
    The network is decentralized, two-ranked network, with nodes and clients.<br>
    Nodes handle all the routing and packet delivery, while clients are just connected to the network.<br>
    Computers use custom IPv2 address system, which look like this: <b>1a2b:ef17</b><br>
    Hostnames are also supported, provided by MNP protocol.
